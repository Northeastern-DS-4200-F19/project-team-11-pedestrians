      <h1>Project Team 11: Crime and Safety around Chester Square Park, DS 4200 F19</h1>

      <p><strong>Karman Singh</strong>, <strong>Eric Chung</strong>, <strong>Edward Chung</strong></p>

      <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>,
				taught by <a href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>,
				<a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>

      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p><em>For this project, we decided to focus on pedestrian safety and how to make the park more safe for both residents of the homes nearby
						 and anyone walking by the park itself.</em></p>
      <p><em>What we expect to find using the data visualization that we are creating is an addressable to trend in crime around Chester Square Park.
						 We are using crime data as a stand-in for safety data as there is no usable dataset of safety levels around Boston.</em></p>

      <h1>Visualization</h1>
      <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="container vis-holder">
              <div class="row section center">
                <div class="col">
                  <div class="row"><svg id="vis3"></svg></div>
                  <div class="row"><svg id="vis4"></svg></div>
                  <div class="row section center">
                      <button class="btn" data-activity="crime">Crime</button>

      <h1>Demo Video</h1>

      <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>

      <video controls width="100%">
        <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
         a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
      </video>

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

      <p><em>final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em>The primary dataset that we used was the Boston Crime dataset pulled from the Analyze Boston website. Due to the fact that the dataset was
				very large (over 450,000 entries) we did a lot of preprocessing using Python to aggregate the data ahead of time. For example, for the crime count by hour
				chart, we ran a python script on the Boston crime dataset ahead of time to aggregate the data by hour before displaying the data using D3.</em></p>

      <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.
				Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>
			<p><em>We began our design process by looking at already existing visualizations of crime data for Boston. While looking at the visualizations, we
				noticed that there was a common theme in that all of the already existing visualizations did not have good visual encodings and were overall very
				unintuitive. A common problem was the color schemes for the visualizations were very poorly chosen. With this information in mind, we decided
				that we would create a better crime map for Boston. <br><br> On top of creating a crime map, we also surveyed safety levels of residents around Chester
			 	Square Park and plan to compare crime levels with perceived safety levels around the Park. We hope to find a correlation between crime and safety
			 	around the park so as to use the crime dataset we have as an analog for Safety data.</em></p>

      <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
      Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
      Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
